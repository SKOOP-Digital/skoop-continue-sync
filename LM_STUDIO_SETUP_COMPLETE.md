# ✅ LM Studio + Continue.dev Configuration Complete!

## Setup Complete

Your Continue.dev is now configured to use the Instinct model running in LM Studio with GPU acceleration.

## Configuration Details

### LM Studio Settings:
1. **Make sure LM Studio server is running**
   - Default port: `1234`
   - Model: Instinct (nate/instinct)
   - GPU acceleration: Enabled

### Continue.dev Configuration:
- **Provider**: `lmstudio`
- **API Base**: `http://localhost:1234/v1`
- **Model**: Uses whatever model is loaded in LM Studio

## How to Use

1. **Start LM Studio**:
   - Load the Instinct model
   - Start the server (usually auto-starts)
   - Verify it shows "Server running on port 1234"

   if it doesn't manually start, run
   lms server start --port 3000


2. **In VS Code with Continue**:
   - Open Continue panel (Cmd/Ctrl + L)
   - You should see "Instinct-LMStudio" as the model
   - Start chatting or use autocomplete

## Performance Benefits

Since LM Studio is using your GPU:
- ✅ **Fast responses** - GPU acceleration
- ✅ **Low CPU usage** - Offloaded to GPU
- ✅ **Better than Ollama** - LM Studio has better Intel GPU support
- ✅ **No NPU wait** - Works with your current hardware

## Configuration Files

I've created both formats for you:
- `continue_config_lmstudio.json` - JSON format (now active)
- `continue_config_lmstudio.yaml` - YAML format (backup)

Both are configured and the JSON version is copied to your Continue config.

## Verify It's Working

1. Check LM Studio shows GPU usage when generating
2. Task Manager should show Intel GPU activity
3. CPU usage should stay low (< 30%)

## Troubleshooting

If Continue can't connect:
1. Verify LM Studio server is running
2. Check the port (default 1234)
3. Try reloading VS Code window
4. Make sure model is loaded in LM Studio

## Alternative Ports

If LM Studio is using a different port, update the config:
```json
"apiBase": "http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/v1"
```

---

**Your setup is complete!** LM Studio with GPU acceleration is the best current solution for your Intel hardware until NPU support matures.
