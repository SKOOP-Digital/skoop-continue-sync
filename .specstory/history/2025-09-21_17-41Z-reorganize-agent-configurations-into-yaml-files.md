# Reorganize agent configurations into YAML files (2025-09-21 17:41Z)

_**User (2025-09-21 16:12Z)**_


instead of having the agents in team-config.json, put them in a folder called agents each with a yaml file foreach agent.
The extension configs can stay in the team-config.js
but the agents need to go in their own yaml files.
Also there will be noo top level docs, prompts, models, rules, .... all these will go underr the agents only.
there always will be one agent called 'Local Agent'. this is the default continue agent andit's yaml goes into config.yaml. all the other agents go into the .continue/agents folder

additionally, the configuration for our things is wrong, here is a working agent configuration that you should use:

 just make a couple of variations of this one for making 2 agents.

## Updating Configuration

- team-config.json was modified to retain only extension-specific settings, like liteLLM and vscodeSettings.  
- All other sections, including agents and docs, were removed to streamline the configuration.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully restructured your Continue configuration as requested. Here's what I've accomplished:

## ✅ Configuration Restructure Complete

**Updated `team-config.json`:**
- Removed all agents, docs, prompts, models, and rules
- Kept only extension-specific configs: `liteLLM` and `vscodeSettings`

**Created new folder structure:**
- `config.yaml` - The "Local Agent" (default Continue agent)
- `.continue/agents/` folder containing:
  - `skoop-code-reviewer.yaml` - Advanced code review agent
  - `skoop-bug-fixer.yaml` - Intelligent debugging agent

## Agent Configurations

**Local Agent (`config.yaml`):**
- Basic default configuration for general development tasks
- Standard models and minimal prompts/rules

**Skoop Code Reviewer (`.continue/agents/skoop-code-reviewer.yaml`):**
- Uses the exact template structure you provided
- Comprehensive code review prompts and security-focused rules
- Full set of MCP servers for advanced analysis

**Skoop Bug Fixer (`.continue/agents/skoop-bug-fixer.yaml`):**
- Variation of the template optimized for debugging:
  - Lower temperature (0.1) for more deterministic, precise responses
  - Debugging-specific prompts and rules
  - Error handling and investigation focus
  - Additional debugging tools (git integration)

All agents follow your provided YAML schema (`v1`) and use the same LiteLLM API configuration. The agents are now properly separated from extension settings, with the Local Agent serving as the default Continue agent and specialized agents available in the `.continue/agents/` folder.
