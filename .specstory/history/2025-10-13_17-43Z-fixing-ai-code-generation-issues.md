why is my ai generating code with these special characters not correct? how can i prompt it not to do that

edit the 'Important Instructions' rule to add these instructions to the ai

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about an AI generating HTML code with special characters like `&lt;` and `&gt;` instead of `<` and `>`. They want to know why this is happening and how to prompt the AI not to do that. They also want me to edit the 'Important Instructions' rule to add these instructions to the AI.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see this is a VS Code extension that syncs Continue.dev settings. The user is asking about an AI generating HTML code with HTML entities (`&lt;` and `&gt;`) instead of actual angle brackets (`<` and `>`), and they want to know how to prevent this and edit some "Important Instructions" rule.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>It looks like there's a YAML syntax error in the file. The issue is that the `.gitignore` entry on line 4 seems to be part of a YAML list, but the indentation or structure is incorrect. Let me check the original file structure around that area to see what went wrong.</details></think>

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: test-config-v3-prod.yaml

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issue! The YAML structure under the `continueignore` setting is malformed. It should be properly indented as a YAML list. The patterns should be under a `patterns` key or properly formatted as a list. Let me check how this is supposed to be structured by looking at the processing code in the extension.</details></think>

</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see from the code that the continueignore section is supposed to have patterns stored in a `patterns` array. Looking at the processing code on lines 399-406, it looks for lines that don't contain ':' and don't start with '  -', and treats them as patterns to add to a patterns array.


## Examining code behavior
- The `continueignore` section in the code is designed to store patterns in a `patterns` array.
- Lines 399-406 process text by identifying lines without ':' and not starting with '  -', treating them as patterns to add to the array.</details></think>
