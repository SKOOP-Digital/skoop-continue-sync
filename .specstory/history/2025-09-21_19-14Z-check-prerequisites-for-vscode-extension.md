_**User (2025-09-21 16:12Z)**_

add a check to this sync extension to make sure that the following extensions are installed when installing this extension to vscode. if not install them first.

also make surethisextension will work on windows, mac,and linux.

also make sure any other prerequisits that are needed are installed

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Excellent! All tasks are completed. Let me summarize what I've done for the user.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully added the prerequisite checks and cross-platform support to your VSCode extension. Here's what I implemented:

## âœ… **Extension Dependencies**
Added `extensionDependencies` to `package.json` to automatically prompt users to install the required extensions:
- `Continue.continue`
- `SpecStory.specstory-vscode`

When users install your extension, VSCode will automatically prompt them to install these dependencies if they're missing.

## âœ… **Cross-Platform Support**
Added platform and architecture specifications to ensure the extension works on:
- **Windows** (`win32`) - x64 and ARM64
- **macOS** (`darwin`) - x64 and ARM64  
- **Linux** (`linux`) - x64 and ARM64

## âœ… **Runtime Prerequisite Checks**
Added comprehensive checks during extension activation:

1. **Activation Check**: When the extension activates, it verifies that required extensions are installed and shows an error message with installation links if missing.

2. **Command Execution Checks**: Both commands (`applyTeamSettings` and `clearAllConfigs`) now verify prerequisites before executing, preventing runtime errors.

3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages guide users to install missing extensions, with direct links to the marketplace.

## âœ… **Build Verification**
- Extension compiles without errors
- Packages successfully (23 files, 249.51 KB)
- Ready for distribution

The extension now ensures a smooth installation experience across all supported platforms and provides clear feedback when prerequisites aren't met. Users will be guided to install the necessary extensions automatically through VSCode's dependency system.
