# Configuring token usage in continue.dev (2025-09-21 22:40Z)

_**User (2025-09-21 16:12Z)**_

This extensionis workingwell, but what about configurations around token useage, like how much context for autocomplete, and howdeep to go on docs, and anything else like that? Howdo i set all this in continue.dev?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about configuring token usage and context settings in Continue.dev. From the web search results I have, I can see that this is about configuring the autocomplete behavior in Continue.dev.


## Investigating Continue.dev settings  
- The user wants to configure token usage and context settings in Continue.dev.  
- This involves adjusting autocomplete behavior within the Continue.dev platform.</details></think>

---

Based on the Continue.dev documentation, you can configure token usage and context settings through a `config.yaml` file in your home directory:

- **MacOS/Linux**: `~/.continue/config.yaml`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.yaml`

Here are the key configuration options for controlling token usage and autocomplete context:

## Core Token and Context Settings

```yaml
tabAutocompleteOptions:
  maxPromptTokens: 400          # Maximum tokens for autocomplete prompt
  prefixPercentage: 0.5         # Proportion of prompt for code before cursor (0.0-1.0)
  multilineCompletions: "always" # "always", "never", or "auto"
```

## Additional Autocomplete Controls

You can also manage these settings through the **User Settings Page** in the Continue interface (click the gear icon):

- **Multiline Autocompletions**: Set to `always`, `never`, or `auto` (defaults to `auto`)
- **Disable autocomplete in files**: Comma-separated glob patterns like `*.md,*.txt`

## What Each Setting Controls

- **`maxPromptTokens`**: Balances context depth vs performance - higher values give more context but may slow responses
- **`prefixPercentage`**: Controls how much of the prompt focuses on code before vs after the cursor
- **`multilineCompletions`**: Whether suggestions can span multiple lines

## Important Notes

- The `config.json` format is deprecated - use `config.yaml` instead
- For documentation depth, this is primarily controlled by the `maxPromptTokens` setting
- If you're not seeing completions, ensure "Enable Tab Autocomplete" is checked in your IDE settings

For a complete reference of all configuration options, check the [config.yaml Reference](https://docs.continue.dev/reference/config) in the Continue.dev docs.

what other options are there that affect token useage

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking for more options that affect token usage in Continue.dev beyond what I mentioned earlier. Looking at the web search results and documentation provided, I can see several additional configuration options that affect token usage:


## Examining token usage options  
- Continue.dev offers additional configuration settings impacting token usage beyond initial options.  
- Web search and documentation highlight these settings for optimizing token consumption in the platform.</details></think>

---

Based on the Continue.dev documentation, here are additional configuration options that affect token usage beyond the basic `maxPromptTokens` and `prefixPercentage` settings:

## Model-Specific Token Controls

In your `config.yaml`, you can configure token usage per model in the `models` section:

```yaml
models:
  - name: YourModelName
    provider: YourProvider
    model: YourModel
    defaultCompletionOptions:
      contextLength: 4096        # Maximum context window size
      maxTokens: 1500            # Maximum tokens to generate per completion
      temperature: 0.7           # Controls randomness (affects token selection)
      topP: 0.9                  # Nucleus sampling (affects token diversity)
      topK: 50                   # Limits token choices per step
```

## Autocomplete Context Management

```yaml
autocompleteOptions:
  maxPromptTokens: 1024          # Overall token limit for autocomplete
  maxSuffixPercentage: 0.2       # How much context after cursor (0.0-1.0)
  prefixPercentage: 0.5          # How much context before cursor (0.0-1.0)
  onlyMyCode: true               # Only include repository code (reduces tokens)
  useCache: true                 # Cache completions (saves tokens)
  useImports: true               # Include imports in context
  useRecentlyEdited: true        # Include recently edited files
  useRecentlyOpened: true        # Include recently opened files
```

## Request and Performance Settings

```yaml
requestOptions:
  timeout: 30                    # Request timeout in seconds
  modelTimeout: 5000             # Autocomplete model timeout in milliseconds
  debounceDelay: 250             # Delay before triggering autocomplete
```

## Key Token Usage Impact Factors

- **`contextLength`**: The maximum context window your model supports (e.g., 4096 for GPT-3.5, 8192 for GPT-4)
- **`maxTokens`**: Limits how many tokens the model generates in a single response
- **`onlyMyCode`**: When `true`, excludes external documentation/libraries from context, reducing token usage
- **`useCache`**: Reuses previous completions, reducing API calls and token consumption
- **`maxSuffixPercentage`**: Controls how much of the prompt is allocated to code after the cursor

## Additional Context Control

In the User Settings Page (gear icon in Continue interface), you can also:

- **Disable autocomplete in files**: Use glob patterns like `*.md,*.txt` to exclude certain file types from autocomplete context
- **Multiline completions**: Set to `never` to reduce token usage by avoiding multi-line suggestions

These settings help you balance between comprehensive context (more tokens) and performance/cost efficiency (fewer tokens). The `onlyMyCode: true` setting is particularly effective for reducing token usage while maintaining relevant code context.

## Investigating User Hardware  
- The user wants to run the "Instinct" model locally on an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V.  
- Checking compatibility with Windows AI Accelerator and Copilot platform for local execution.

## Investigating User Hardware  
- Found guidance on running AI models on Intel Core Ultra processors, leveraging NPU with ONNX Runtime and OpenVINO.  
- The "Instinct" model isn't a standard AI model; it could be from a specific provider, custom, or misnamed.  
- Continue.dev supports local options like Ollama and LM Studio, but Instinct's compatibility needs clarification.  
- Windows AI Accelerator and Copilot platform offer steps for Intel processors, potentially relevant to user's setup.  
- Need to verify if "Instinct" aligns with supported models for local execution on the user's hardware.</details></think>
